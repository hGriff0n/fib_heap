The goal of this project is to present a singular location where I have implemented various
  algorithms and data structures using Rust. I'm also planning to implement Rust's standard
  library within this project as a sub-crate. Efficiency is a minor concern atm, as I'm not
  used to Rust yet.

Current Algorithms and Data Structures List:

  1) Fibonacci Heap

Project Organization:

    src (rust_algos)
     |- algs (algorithms)
     |   |- sorts
     |- coll (collections)
     |- std (reimplementation of rust std)
